# UniAct

UniAct is a full-stack web application project developed using **TypeScript**, with both frontend and backend components. This project was created during my **first year** of university as part of an introductory course on web development. It served as a final semester project, helping me explore the fundamentals of building complete web applications from scratch.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
UniAct/
├── client/         # Frontend (React-based, written in TypeScript)
├── server/         # Backend (Node.js or Express with TypeScript)
├── docker-compose.yml  # Docker orchestration setup
└── README.md
```

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - TypeScript
  - CSS / HTML
  - React (assumed)

- **Backend:**
  - Node.js
  - TypeScript

- **DevOps / Tools:**
  - Docker
  - Docker Compose

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 16
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git

### Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PhoorinNickphong/UniAct.git
cd UniAct

# Start services
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start both the frontend and backend containers.

## 📦 Features

- Type-safe full-stack architecture
- Modular codebase for scalability
- Easy to deploy via Docker
- Good foundation for web or IoT-based apps

## 📘 Background

This was my first exposure to full-stack development during Year 1 of my studies. Through this project, I learned:
- How frontend and backend communicate via APIs
- How to use Docker for development
- How to organize code into client-server architecture

It marked the beginning of my interest in IoT and scalable web application design.

## 🔧 Future Improvements

- [ ] Add authentication system
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests
- [ ] Setup CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- [ ] Add API documentation (e.g. Swagger)
